            <li>America needed a new baseball hero in 1951.  Mickey Mantle became that hero.  With television sets beginning to appear in every American home, we were able to watch Mickey and the Yankees virtually every Saturday on the Game of the Week and practically every October in the World Series.  Because of his Herculean homers and his amazing clutch hitting, the name Mickey Mantle became synonymous with the Fall Classic.
                After Mickey hit a 565’ homer completely out of Griffith Stadium in 1953, the term “Tape Measure Homer” was coined.  Afterwards, Mickey hit gigantic homers completely out of almost every major league stadium that he ever played in except Yankee Stadium which he missed doing so by just inches in 1956 and again in 1963.
                Mickey’s life and career are ones of perseverance, courage, determination, amazing feats and true greatness.  The Mantle family sincerely hopes that you enjoy this site and through it, learn a little more about the baseball player and the man known simply as “The Mick”.</li>
